  <!-- We assume that we will only be comparing one database at a time.
       So, we can simply match our database, and cluster objects based
       only on object type, hence match="type" for these dbobjects.
       Also, we would not want to compare on the basis of database name
       as it is likely we want to compare two different databases and
       they will probably have different names. -->
