	  If we are changing ownership and the owner is a new role, our
	  diffprep node will depend on the creation of the role (and
	  some appropriate privileges).  Hence the conditional
	  dependencies.

          The direction stuff looks kinda odd.  Here is how it works:
          The dependency-set applies attribute makes the dependency-set
          apply to the backwards side of the dependency graph (ie for
          the diffprep rather than the diff node), which is where object
          ownership changes are applied.  The direction attribute
          overrides the natural direction of the dependency set to make
          its dependencies (and fallback) directed to the forwards side
          of the graph (where the new owner role will be created if it
          does not already exist).  Note that dependencies from the drop
          side of the graph to the build side are somewhat dangerous as
          they can easily lead to dependency cycles.  In our case that
          is not a problem since the dependencies are effectively on the
          owner role (through grants on that role), and roles can have
          no dependencies to the drop side as their diffprep nodes will
          contain no code, and their only other dependencies are to the
          cluster, which can only ever be an EXISTS_NODE.  -->
