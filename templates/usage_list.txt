       -l, --list

           --gra, --grants
               Add details of grants to the list output. By default grants are
               not shown because they are considered generally uninteresting.

           -c, --contexts
               Add details of contexts to the list output. Contexts are
               relevant only when list is run on a stream created by generate.
               Context entries show where the generated script switches the
               effective user before performing an operation, ie the context
               describes the user that performs DDL operations.

               By default context is not shown because it is an artefact of
               the generated DDL script and not part of the resulting
               database.

           -f, --fallbacks
               Add details of fallbacks to the list output. Fallbacks are
               relevant only when list is run on a stream created by generate.
               Fallback entries show where the generated script temporarily
               provides extra privileges to a role before performing an
               operation.

               By default fallbacks are not shown because they are artefacts
               of the generated DDL script and not part of the resulting
               database.

           Takes an input stream and generates an XML print stream, which
           summarises its contents. The source stream can be a stream produced
           by extract, diff, or generate.

           If a filename is provided to this command, the file will be read
           and added to the stack before processing.
