       -s, --scatter

           -v, --verbose
               Print, to the XML print stream, summary data for all files
               rather than just those that have been changed.

           --ch, --checkonly
               Produce only the XML print stream, IE do not write any output
               files.

           -q, --quiet, --si, --silent
               Do not print summary data to the output stream. These flags
               take precedence over the verbose flags.

           Scatters the contents of an XML stream into a directory tree with
           one file per major database object. The resulting directory
           hierarchy is suitable for inclusion into a repository managed by a
           Source Code Management (SCM) system.

           The rootmost entry of the scattered directory tree is always called
           cluster.xml. If this file is provided a parameter to any skit
           command, the entire directory tree will be read. IE, for skit's
           purposes there is no difference between a file containing an XML
           stream, and the root file of a scattered directory tree.

           If a filename is provided to this command, the file will be read
           and added to the stack.

               Note
               Unless one of the quiet flags is provided, an XML print stream
               will be generated which will provide a summary of files created
               and/or modified.
