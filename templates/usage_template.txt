       -t, --template
           This command evaluates a skit XML template file. Such template
           files can perform any action of which skit is capable, including
           reading from databases.

           This command is actually the basis for almost all of skit's
           built-in commands, and the following shell commands are entirely
           equivalent:

               $ skit --generate --build mydb.xml

               $ skit --template generate.xml --build mydb.xml
