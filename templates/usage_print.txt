       -p, --print

           -x, --xml
               Print the output as a pure XML stream without interpretation.
               This is only useful for examining the contents of print
               streams. Applying this option to any other sort of XML stream
               will have no effect.

           -f, --full
               Print the output as a pure XML stream and also leave any
               <dbobject> elements added by adddeps commands, in place. Note
               that for diff streams <dbobject> elements are always left in
               place, so this option will have no effect.

           Print an XML stream to standard output. By default, the stream is
           interpreted allowing print streams to be printed as pure text.

           If a filename is provided to this command, the file will be read
           and added to the stack before processing.

       -pf, --printfull
           As --print --full.

       -x, --px, --printxml
           As --print --xml.
