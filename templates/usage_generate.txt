       -g, -n, --generate

           -d, --drop
               Generate DDL statements to drop all objects in the source
               stream.

                   Note
                   If the source stream is a diff stream, this flag is
                   ignored.

           -b, --build
               Generate DDL statements to build all objects in the source
               stream. This can be combined with --drop to create a script
               that drops and then rebuilds the database. This is the default
               option for the skitgenerate command so does not need to be
               provided.

                   Note
                   If the source stream is a diff stream, this flag is
                   ignored.

           --de, --debug
               This causes the raw XML produced by the skit:tsort action to be
               written to stdout.

           Takes an input stream and generates DDL to create, build or drop a
           database. If the input is a diff stream (from the skit diff
           command, generate DDL to bring the one database into line with the
           other.

           The DDL is generated an an XML print stream which can be printed as
           text using the skit print command.

           The output is in the form of an executable shell script, though
           this may change in future versions. You should not execute this
           script directly, but should examine it carefully to ensure that it
           does what you expect.
