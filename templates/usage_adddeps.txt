       -a, --adddeps
           Takes an XML stream as created by extract and wraps each database
           object in <dbobject> elements containing dependency and context
           information. This is normally an operation that is performed
           automatically when XML streams are read. This command is intended
           for use primarily for debugging skit. The dependency elements added
           by this command are used by the generate command in order to
           properly order the DDL produced.

           If the input stream already contains <dbobject> elements, this
           command leave the XML stream unaffected.

           If a filename is provided to this command, the file will be read
           and added to the stack before processing.

               Note
               By default, the print performs a remove deps operation before
               producing output so if you want to see the transformation
               created by this command, you will need to use the --full of
               print.
