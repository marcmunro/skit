<!--
  Argument definition for the connect action.  All that connect does is
  provide definitions for a bunch of symbols which are used later when
  connecting to a database.

  Synopsis (\- represents a single hyphen character)
    skit \-\-connect [OPTIONS]... [ARG]

    Options:
        \-\-db[type]
	The type of database to which we will connect.  The default is
	postgres.

        \-\-c[onnect]=string
	A full database connection string in whatever form the specified
	database connector allows.  Note that the optional ARG parameter
	does the same thing.

	\-\-d[atabase]=string
	The name of the database to which we wish to connect.

	\-\-h[ost]=string
	The hostname or address of the database server to which we wish
	to connect.

	\-\-p[ort]=string
	The port number for the database server to which we wish
	to connect.

	\-\-u[sername]=string
	The username to be used for the database connection.

	\-\-pass[word]=string
	The password to be used for the database connection.  Using this
	is a bad idea from a security point of view.
