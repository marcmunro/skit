  <title>Skit Policies</title>
  <para>
    This will describe various development policies within skit.  In
    particular, the intent with regard to generated
    <acronym>DDL</acronym>, the strange use of make and the Makefile
    hierarchy, coding standards, etc.  The intent is that this is not an
    onerous, prescriptive section, but rather one that explains where
    the developers are coming from.

    <title>Why the GPL?</title>
    <para>
      The choice of licence for a project can be contentious.  It is not
      an easy choice.
    </para>
    <para>
      The GPL was chosen for a number of reasons, all seriously
      considered.  Marc believes that Free Software is important, and
      that the GPL best ensures the freedom of the users of that
      software.  Although other licenses may be more liberal, by
      explictly allowing commercialisation of the software, doing so
      takes away the freedom to use derivative works from the world at
      large.   It grants a freedom to a small self-interested group, at
      the expense of the larger community.

    <para>
      You may disagree with this belief, but please respect the choice
      of license that has been made.  Skit represents many hundreds of
      man hours of development and is being freely given to the
      community.

	If you want a commercial license, please get in touch with
	Marc.  If it is for a product derived from PostgreSQL you will
	find a sympathetic ear, and a willingness to help.
