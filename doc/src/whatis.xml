  <title>What is skit?</title>
  <para> 
    Skit is a command-line tool for managing database development. Its
    purpose is to allow database definitions to be managed using a
    Source Code Management system, and to provide the means to upgrade
    and patch databases in a similar way to that done for source code.
  </para>
  <para>
    It provides the means to identify and examine all of the objects in
    a database, to identify differences between databases, and to
    generate and regenerate code to recreate and modify those databases.
  </para>
  <para>
    Finally, it also provides a general-purpose mechanism for creating,
    manipulating and validating database objects programmatically.
  </para>
  <para>
    The current implementation (&version;) supports only PostgreSQL but
    the underlying engine is designed to be database-agnostic.  Adding
    support for other databases is intended to be relatively
    straightforward.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that <application>skit</application> currently deals only with
    database objects and not with data.  If you have Meta-data to
    manage, it will have to be managed independently
    of <application>skit</application>.
