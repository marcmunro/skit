  <title>Build options and performance</title>
  <para>
    As skit is currently in an alpha-testing phase, a number of debug
    options enabled by default.  These can have a significant impact on
    performance.

    In particular the default skit build includes a  memory tracking
    subsystem, which records each malloc call in a hash so that we can
    ensure that it is subsequently freed.  This adds a significant
    overhead.  To disable memory tracking, add
    <arg>--enable-mtrack=np</arg> to the <command>configure</command>
    when building skit.
