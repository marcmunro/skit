    This section of the manual is aimed at those who wish to enhance
    skit and/or develop new features.  In time it will describe the
    overall skit architecture, provide a reference for
    <literal>skit-xml</literal> and skit's <literal>babylisp</literal>
    expression language.  It will describe debugging techniques, and
    explain how to create skit template files to create custom
    functionality.
