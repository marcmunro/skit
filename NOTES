Next tasks:

1) Add node traversal optimisation to gensort
We want tsort output to be better cost-optimised.  When we are visiting
a particular point in the tree, we should do as much as possible at that
point before departing to other points in the tree.

The algorithm needs to be refined.  There should be a switch to use the
current non-optimised algorithm.

algorithm:

tsort(remaining_list):
  buildlist = new empty list
  cost_node = NULL
  while (there are elements in remaining_list or candidate_list)
    append all leaf nodes from remaining_list to candidate_list
    if candidate_list was lengthened by above operation
      costsort(cost_node, candidate_list)
    cost_node = candidate_list.pop()
    remove cost_node from remaining_list, eliminating deps as we do it
    append cost_node to buildlist

costsort(node, list):
  sort list so that similarly located elements are placed next to each
  other, pretending that node is the zeroth element of list and is not
  movable.

  If we have this node:
    a.b

  And this list:
    a.c  a.b.d  a.b.d.e  a.b.d.f  a.b.d.g   a.c.f  g

  The order should be
    a.b.d     (this is at a.b so has zero cost)
    a.b.d.e   (this is at a.b.d so has zero cost)
    a.b.d.g   (this is at a.b.d so has cost a.b.d.e --> a.b.d)
    a.c       (this is at a so has cost a.b.d.e --> a.b.d --> a.b  --> a)
    a.c.f     (this is at a.c so has zero cost)
    g         (this is at root so has cost a.c.f --> a.c --> a  --> root)

  Only traversal back up the tree has a cost.  Within similar cost items,
  we should check for similar contexts, and then sort alphabetically.

  The sort algorithm will be as follows:
  - find set of lowest code nodes from start node
  - group the set into subsets by contexts (owner name)
  - sort each subset alphabetically

  NOTE: rather than building a true sort algorithm, it might be better to
  simply place each new node at the most optimal place in the list as it
  is removed from remaining_list.

    
Plan:

a) add option to select old tsort algorithm
b) create new tsort without costsort
c) test
d) add costsort



2) Add diff handling
This is a biggy.


3) get check working using an out of the box version


4) get all valgrind tests to pass


5) documentation


6) update for the latest versions of postgres


7) initial release


8) implement merge


9) implement grep
