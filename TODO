1) endfallbacks must depend on the role - figure out how to add these
   deps
   fallbacks are added in deps/cluster.xsl

   Probably need to explicitly create endfallback nodes at the same
   time, and copy the deps for the role.  Then iin deps.c where
   fallbacks are activated, activate the endfallback rather than
   creating it as a mirror node.

   Check this by showing the vectorDeps after redirection (uncomment
   lines in vicinity of deps.c:1409) on a generate from the xmlfile
   created by: 
     ./skit --diff regress/scratch/regressdb_dump3a.xml \
     	    regress/scratch/regressdb_dump3b.xml


2) regression_test3 is currently failing
   

3) Check for automatic grants to public in my sql scripts.  schemata.sql
   was wrong, others may be as well.

todo item in regression3b_8_4.sql:  

diffs:
    conversions  (after which we should do the concat thing below in generate)
    functions
    types
    domains
    casts
    operators
    operator_classes
    operator_families
    sequences
    aggregates
    tables
    constraints
    indices
    rules
    views
    triggers

generate:
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl
  - use the concat function rather than sequences of text value-of text, etc
    see the revoke template for an example.  This is more readable and
    more compact.  Should therefore be faster.

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

grep
