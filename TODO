Status:

Dependency handling in diffs needs to be re-implemented.
regression_tests 1 and 2 pass, as do all unit tests

Next planned refactoring is to resolve the isse with test3 by
eliminating the drop-side duplication of fallbacks.  Drop-side
duplication will only be necessary if the parent node of the fallback
node is a rebuild node.

Issue with test3 (use params diffgen2 as test case)
  Issue is that fallbacks depend on granting lose to keep, but lose is
  deing dropped.  Once lose is dropped, the endfallback (revoking it
  again) cannot be performed.

  Possible solution - do not mirror the fallback operations: 
  instead of:
     fallback<-buildside<-endfallback<-dsfallback<-dropside<-endds
  have this:
     fallback<-buildside<-dropside<-endfallback
  and have endfallback demoted to an exists node if any of its
  dependencies are dropped.

Implement code for DEMOTE case in deps.c:redirectNodeDeps

SIMPLE TODOS:
   Remove nav code from ddl/cluster.xsl


Check handling of all existing ownership diffs - are they being handled
in a manner consistent with conversions?


diffs:
    do the concat thing for objects below as in done in generate for
    schemata

    functions (including the concat thing)
    types (including the concat thing)
    domains (including the concat thing)
    casts (including the concat thing)
    operators (including the concat thing)
    operator_classes (including the concat thing)
    operator_families (including the concat thing)
    sequences (including the concat thing)
    aggregates (including the concat thing)
    tables (including the concat thing)
    constraints (including the concat thing)
    indices (including the concat thing)
    rules (including the concat thing)
    views (including the concat thing)
    triggers (including the concat thing)

generate:
  - Add echoes code to all database objects
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
    (actually, for all code)
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

grep
