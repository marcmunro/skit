Properly handle phony targets in GNUMakefiles?

eliminate all ignore-contexts code


make xml-versioning specific to each database type
add --upgrade option to set of supported commands
add xml version checks to existing commands
make directory a mandatory parameter for scatter


generate:
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
    (actually, for all code)
  - allow non-superusers to run skit
  - shout option for ddl (ie upper case)
  - allow upgrades for extensions to be done manually (ie without
    upgrade script).
  - eliminate empty code blocks
  - eliminate any unnecessary grants (there seem to be some associated
    with extensions in 9.1 regression test3)

deps optimisations:
  - When there are fallbacks on both sides but there do not need to be,
    deactivate the fallback and dsendfallback leaving only the
    dsfallback and endfallback.
  - Figure out how to handle auto-dropping of dependent objects (eg
    grant of select on a table when the role or table is dropped).
  - We should optimise the dropping of dependent objects when their
    dependency is dropped.  Eg grants on object when object is dropped.


smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

grep

Others
  Allow handling of a lack of priv by commenting out the code.  This
  probably also requires deps to be marked as temporary or transient or
  some such.

  Allow an as-user opton.

Bugs and Issues:

  Need to consider how to deal with automatically named constraints.

  Figure out how to give useful error messages when we do not have the
  necessary priv for an operation.  To do this we may need the concept
  of a temporary dependency (one that only needs to exist for the
  duration of the build/drop/diff actions, and not subsequently. 

  Allow nodes to be dependent on alternate parents (eg for cluster
  objects such as roles, tablespaces, etc)?

REFACTORINGS
Remove as many attributes as possible from the dbobject element.
Particularly role_name, table_name and qname.  Move any needed fields
into the actual dbobject (eg table, role, view) objects.

add tablespace_is_default attribute for sequences, constraints and
indices.
