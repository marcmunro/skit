Current issue is a failure in regression_test3

    Work is in progress to make fallbacks automatically generated at
    need rather than created by default (by the deps handling stuff).
    Currently deps.c contains hackish code to created the dagnode for 
    a new fallback.  This must be replaced by an xsl-based mechanism.
    All unit tests current pass as do regression tests 1 and 2.

    Once fallbacks are automatically creatable, the conditional handling
    of diffdeps in diff.c:dbObjectDiffOld can be enabled.  This should
    finally solve the regression_test3 issue.

Rename dbobjectDiffOld in diff.c

deps handling:
    build cylic dependency deps so that the swap phase for backward
      breakers is handled solely by redirectDeps and the swap phase can
      be eliminated.

Look for uses of nodeAttribute() that can be replaced by
nodeHasAttribute(), ditto for direct use of xmlGetProp()


diffs:
    do the concat thing below in generate for schemata

    functions (including the concat thing)
    types (including the concat thing)
    domains (including the concat thing)
    casts (including the concat thing)
    operators (including the concat thing)

generate:
  - Add echoes code to all database objects
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
    (actually, for all code)
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate
