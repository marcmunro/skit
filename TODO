    do the concat thing below in generate for languages, roles,
    tablespaces, schemata

    functions (including the concat thing)
    types (including the concat thing)
    domains (including the concat thing)
    casts (including the concat thing)
    operators (including the concat thing)

    constraints (including the concat thing)
    indices (including the concat thing)
    rules (including the concat thing)
    views (including the concat thing)
    triggers (including the concat thing)

generate:
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl
  - use the concat function rather than sequences of text value-of text, etc
    see the revoke template for an example.  This is more readable and
    more compact.  Should therefore be faster.

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

grep
