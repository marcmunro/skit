Modify dependency definitions for owner in conversions to use a grant
from one role to another rather than superuser.  Also depend on this.

MAKE FALLBACKS PART OF THE DB INSTEAD OF PART OF THE CLUSTER

CHECK THAT MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF FALLBACKS DO NOT RESULT IN MULTIPLE
ATTEMPTS TO CREATE THEM.

deps handling:
    build cylic dependency deps so that the swap phase for backward
      breakers is handled solely by redirectDeps and the swap phase can
      be eliminated.

Look for uses of nodeAttribute() that can be replaced by
nodeHasAttribute(), ditto for direct use of xmlGetProp()

Change key for roles in diffs to be name rather than fqn.


diffs:
    do the concat thing for objects below as in done in generate for
    schemata

    functions (including the concat thing)
    types (including the concat thing)
    domains (including the concat thing)
    casts (including the concat thing)
    operators (including the concat thing)
    operator_classes (including the concat thing)
    operator_families (including the concat thing)
    sequences (including the concat thing)
    aggregates (including the concat thing)
    tables (including the concat thing)
    constraints (including the concat thing)
    indices (including the concat thing)
    rules (including the concat thing)
    views (including the concat thing)
    triggers (including the concat thing)

generate:
  - Add echoes code to all database objects
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
    (actually, for all code)
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort
