1) regression_test3 is currently failing
   
2) Check for automatic grants to public in my sql scripts.  schemata.sql
   was wrong, others may be as well.

3) Ensure that all regress/*_allowed_diffs* files contain only the
   minimum set of entries required.

todo item in regression3b_8_4.sql:  

diffs:
    conversions  (after which we should do the concat thing below in generate)
    functions
    types
    domains
    casts
    operators
    operator_classes
    operator_families
    sequences
    aggregates
    tables
    constraints
    indices
    rules
    views
    triggers

generate:
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl
  - use the concat function rather than sequences of text value-of text, etc
    see the revoke template for an example.  This is more readable and
    more compact.  Should therefore be faster.

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

grep
