Check that acls are handled properly (returning null if that's what they
  contain, in all of the sql files.

    WORKING ON THIS.


Check handling of all existing ownership diffs - are they being handled
in a manner consistent with conversions?

diffs:
    do the concat thing for objects below as in done in generate for
    schemata (in ddl)

    functions (including the concat thing)

    function diffs:
      change parameter type			fn1
      change parameter name			fn2
      change parameter mode			fn5
      change owner				fn6
      change source				fn3
      change bin				not doable, probably works

generate:
  - Add echoes code to all database objects
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
    (actually, for all code)
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

The FBDROP and FBBUILD redirectActionTypes in deps.c are nasty hacks.
Although they *may* be safe they should be replaced with something more
elegant.  What may be needed is a separation of the fallback nodes into
fallback and drop-side fallback variants.  Each of these would be
created when resolving the appropriate DAG (forwards or backwards).
