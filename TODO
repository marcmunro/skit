generate:
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl
  - use the concat function rather than sequences of text value-of text, etc
    see the revoke template for an example.  This is more readable and
    more compact.  Should therefore be faster.

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

grep
