Check handling of all existing ownership diffs - are they being handled
in a manner consistent with conversions?

Check the allowed diffs (in regress_run.,sh) - are they needed?

diffs:
    do the concat thing for objects below as in done in generate for
    schemata

    functions (including the concat thing)
    types (including the concat thing)
    domains (including the concat thing)
    casts (including the concat thing)
    operators (including the concat thing)
    operator_classes (including the concat thing)
    operator_families (including the concat thing)
    sequences (including the concat thing)
    aggregates (including the concat thing)
    tables (including the concat thing)
    constraints (including the concat thing)
    indices (including the concat thing)
    rules (including the concat thing)
    views (including the concat thing)
    triggers (including the concat thing)

generate:
  - Add echoes code to all database objects
  - ensure vertical spacing is good in code generated for diffs
    (actually, for all code)
  - eliminate QQQ commented lines in ddl/*.xsl

smart tsort:
    new tsort function
    change name of tsort selection from simple_tsort to fast_tsort

make the echoes option functional in generate 
change name of ignore-contexts option in generate

grep

The FBDROP and FBBUILD redirectActionTypes in deps.c are nasty hacks.
Although they *may* be safe they should be replaced with something more
elegant.  What may be needed is a separation of the fallback nodes into
fallback and drop-side fallback variants.  Each of these would be
created when resolving the appropriate DAG (forwards or backwards).
